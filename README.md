# Py-Minesweeper
This project is my take on implementation of the old and popular Windows game called [Minesweeper](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minesweeper_(video_game)). It is written in Python
with [pygame](https://www.pygame.org) library. It offers refreshed UI and three predefined levels of diffuculty; codebase of the project is object oriented.
