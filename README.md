# Py-Minesweeper
This project is my take on implementation of the old and popular Windows game called [Minesweeper](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minesweeper_(video_game)). It is written in Python
with [pygame](https://www.pygame.org) library. It offers refreshed UI and three predefined levels of diffuculty; codebase of the project is object oriented.

# Requirements 
-  you have to have at least `Python 3.8` version (I am using `Assignment Expressions`)
- `pygame` (tested on version `2.5.2`)
> pip install pygame 

# Getting started
1. clone this repository:
> git clone https://github.com/Shintenza/py-minesweeper
2. navigate to the cloned directory:
> cd py-minesweeper
3. start playing (i assume that your Linux distro uses python3 by default):
> python game.py
